We are the University of Sussex Psychology Department's dedicated resource for software 
project work.  We specialise in developing and supporting software-based tools and applications for psychology research. 
The team has a wide experience of software projects in psychology, from experiments in jspsych, python, MATLAB and 
unusual Qualtrics setups, to large online interventions, digital health apps, tablet games and VR.

### Software development

*   **Web and Mobile Applications:** e.g. Online interventions, longitudinal studies, data platforms.

*   **Games & Virtual Reality (VR):** Tablet games, and immersive experiences.

*   **Psychology Experiment Infrastructure:** We support developing programming infrastructure to provide stable platforms for experiment hosting.

### Do you want to work with us?

Additionally to supporting research in our Department, we are also open to working on contracts with other departments and disciplines,
that would benefit from a research fluent programming team.  We offer
a number of services, including:

*  **Application Design Workshops:** We can help you design your application, from the ground up using 'joint application 
design' techniques in a series of workshops.  This is perfect for when you have an idea, but are in need of a plan! 

*  **Software Development:** We can develop research software for you, from start to finish. We are experienced in the 
university ecosystem, and can help you navigate the process of getting your software up and running.

*  **Firefighting and Resurrection:** If you have an existing project that is crucial to your research and in peril, we can help you get it back on track.
