Welcome to the SPST website!  We are the University of Sussex Psychology Department's dedicated resource for software solutions.  We specialise in developing and supporting software-based tools and applications for psychology research. The team has a wide experience of software projects in psychology, from experiments in jspsych, python, MATLAB and unusual Qualtrics setups, to large online interventions, digital health apps, tablet games and VR.

### Software Development

*   **Web and Mobile Applications:** e.g. Online interventions, longitudinal studies, data platforms.

*   **Games & Virtual Reality (VR):** Tablet games, and immersive experiences.

*   **Support, Programming Assistance and Code Review:** Assistance is offered in the form of code reviews and support for any software-related challenges that may occur in the course of your research. We will also be aiming to offer more extensive training in software skills.

*   **Psychology Experiment Infrastructure:** We support developing programming infrastructure to provide stable platforms for experiment hosting.

*   **Contact us:** We also welcome any opportunity to help you explore new ideas and transform your research objectives into a digital reality. Please feel free to contact us with any queries or potential project discussions.[**j.alvarez@sussex.ac.uk**](mailto:j.alvarez@sussex.ac.uk) - James Alvarez[**m.lovell@sussex.ac.uk**](mailto:m.lovell@sussex.ac.uk) - Max Lovell
