Whole School & College Approach Online Tool,An online toolkit to allow educational settings to self-assess their whole school and college approach to mental health.    The app was developed over the course of 2 weeks and has had over 300 schools sign up in the first 4 months of release.,"Becca Rendall, NIHR",NIHR,"PHP, Laravel",https://wsca-measurement.co.uk/,1
Perception Census,"An award winning ('Creative effectiveness' category in the CR Annual Awards 2024) online test platform , a collaboration between Sussex and Glasgow Universities and Collective Act. In total, 33,780 people from 133 countries took part, completing 102,689 sections of The Perception Census, making it the largest study of its kind. The findings and insights will impact numerous academic fields from neuroscience, to philosophy, to anthropology. The tests included questionnaires, optical illusions and many different kinds of interactive multimedia based evaluations of perceptual skills and differences.","Anil Seth, University of Sussex & Fiona Macpherson, University of Glasgow",Unboxed (Uk Government),"Jspsych, PHP, Laravel",https://perceptioncensus.dreamachine.world/,0
Colourmind: VR Colour Shifting,"We adapted the latest Oculus rift headset to use 'shaders' which accurately map realistic colours to a transformed colour space, in order to allow experimentation with the human visual system under different visual colour environments.",Anna Franklin,ESRC,"Unity, C#, Oculus Rift",,1
Colourspot,"Colourspot is an iPad game that provides an indicative diagnostic assessment of childrens' colour vision. Children tap coloured dots, and it runs statistical models to detect common colour vision deficiencies. It is currently undergoing a certification process for UKCA marking. The app was built in Unity, with animations and illustrations provided by a designer. The game's display required custom shaders to render a controlled presentation of colours.",Anna Franklin,ESRC,"Unity, C#, C++, iOS",,0
Parenting with Anxiety,The Parenting with Anxiety app is an online version of a successful intervention for parents who have anxiety. The aim of the intervention was to teach parents how to manage their anxiety in a way that makes it less likely to pass on to their children. It was built in Moodle with a RCT framework custom programmed. The results of the RCT were positive and the app is currently in the stages of being implemented bu tje Kent Surrey Sussex Academic Health Science Network!,Sam Cartwright-Hatton,Kavli,"Moodle, PHP",,0
Language Health Centre,"We created a frontend, and contributed to the MLOPs behind a new service designed to allow researchers to access machine learning models for categorising hatespeech online.",Paul Keene,Oracle,"Oracle Apex, Python",,1
Trial Pigeon,"A new service to manage trial related communications (email, SMS, in-app).  Reserarchers can write up emails, and use a flow chart to manage sending reminders and integrate with data gathering platforms such as Qualtrics.",James Alvarez,University of Sussex,"PHP, Laravel",,1
CALMS,We were tasked with updating a mobile application to be used by parents receiving mental health services for children’s disruptive behavioural problems and by academic researchers in this field.  The app required software updates and extensive editing to allow it to be used in a clinical setting to monitor progress of the intervention.,Emily Midouhas,UCL,"Node.js, React",,1

A customisable form creation package, with a UI design to help send reminders and encourage users to fill out necessary data before deadlines.",John Drury,University of Sussex,"PHP, Laravel",,1
Soundsight,"Soundsight is an iOS app which uses depth information from the iPhone camera to generate sounds, which visually impaired people can use to help with navigation. Depth information from the native iPhone cameras, and from third party hardware is transformed into a realtime stream of parameters which are hooked up to a variety of sound loops. The user has the experience of sound changing as they navigate towards and away from obstacles, as well as the quality of sound changing with colour shifts.",Jamie Ward,University of Sussex,"Objective C, iOS",,0
Syntoolkit,"Syntoolkit started as a series of customisable tests for different types of synaesthesia. It grew into a general purpose platform for creating and hosting psychology experiments, with a form builder, experiment flow, and results sharing interface. It is now used within the department by many researchers to help spin up psychology experiments quickly and for free, and to share and collaborate with students and other researchers.",Julia Simner,ESRC,"PHP, Drupal, Javascript",,0
Mass Observation Visualisation,"We inherited a website and an important tool using natural language processing to extract and present themes from first-hand testominies on events given by the public.  The site required a careful upgrade, and provisioning on a new service and several tricky bugs to be fixed!",Justyna Robinson,University of Sussex,Python,,1
